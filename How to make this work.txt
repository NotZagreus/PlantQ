How to make this project work for you.

There are two parts that need attention here, your computer and your raspberrypi.

**Considering you already set up the hardware as I did**
In case you don't, you'll need:
1. A raspberrypi
2. breadboards
3. DHT11 sensor
4. Light sensor
5. Moisture sensor
6. 5V relay
7. 5V water pump
8. Some LEDs (as many as you like)
9. Resistors
10. Cables; male to male and male to female.
11. *Optional* a breadboard extention

Starting with the raspberrypi:

1. Turn on the micro computer and make sure that you have the plant.py file.
2. Run the plant.py file using the "python3 plant.py" command.
3. Look for any error messages that pop up.
4. Smile because it works and records data.

Following with your computer:

1. Get the files from my GitHub, PlantQ project, and import them into an IDE like PyCharm
2. Run the app.py file with the compiler and wait a little
3. Click the link ending with the port :5000, to navigate directly to the login page of the PlantQ website.
4. Enjoy that your plants can now automatically be watered and get sun without having sunlight.
5. Go outside and enjoy life.
